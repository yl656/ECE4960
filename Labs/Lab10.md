# Objective

The objective of this lab is to perform navigation from a random start point to a random end point by combining Bug algorithms (and other local/global algorithms) for path planning and and Bayes/odomtery for localization. As described in my lab 9 report, the restrictions in my apartment hinders the accuracy of my localization, therefore I decided to do this lab completely in the virtual simulator and create a much more interesting geometry that hopefully increases the accuracy of my Bayes filter.

# Simulation

Since I am using the simulator only, I created a much more insteresting map loosely based on my apartment.

With two new trajectories, I tested out how good Bayes localization is.

As we can see, the localization works relatively well, but there are still some outliers.
